My name is Jaerock Kwon. I am an Assistant Professor (2020 - present) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Michigan - Dearborn. 

I was an Assistant (2010 - 2016) and Associate Professor (2016 - 2019) at Kettering Univerisity, Flint, Michigan. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas in 2009. My dissertation title is [Acquisition and Mining of the Whole Mouse Brain Microstructure](https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/ETD-TAMU-2009-08-7049). 

This blog will be about AI, Robotics, and anything else that I am interested in.

I currently live in a suburb of Detroit with my wife.
